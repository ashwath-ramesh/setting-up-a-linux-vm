# Setting up a linux virtual machine

Make a copy of this checklist, and use it to install and deploy your linux virtual machine.

Note:

- This document is intended for my personal use to streamline my personal workflow. This document is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to linux administration.
- Overall structure/outline for this checklist is based on the excellent book 'Mastering Ubuntu Server' by Jay LaCroix. But contents are inspired by multiple linux references mentioned at the end.
